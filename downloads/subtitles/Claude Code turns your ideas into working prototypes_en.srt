00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 Normally, building a web app would take weeks of coding.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,600
 With CodCode, I can delegate the execution.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,439
 Today, we want to have a CodCafe pop-up.

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,320
 Let's ask CodCode to help us build and order management system.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,640
 We need a way for users to place orders,

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,519
 for Bristas to track orders,

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,839
 and for our operations team to monitor wait times.

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,359
 OK, Cod is generating a to-do list

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,039
 so that we can see its plan and edit if needed.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,480
 We can see its building the web app and setting up the database.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,359
 Let's see what CodCode came up with.

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:32,960
 Cool.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,280
 We quickly made a working prototype that's ready for testing.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
 Thanks, Cod.
